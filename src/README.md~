===================================================================
MHS Pointsheet
===================================================================

About the project
=================
This website was made to make it easier for members of MHS to keep track of points earned throughout the year. 
It was started by Colin King in November 2013.
Tested in IE8, Chromium 32, and mobile Safari (iOS7)
To be tested in Safari 6 (?), IE9, and IE10
Note: School computers use IE8-IE10
                            ^ :(

Important Tags
===================
.events
.tutoring
.eventType

Short-term Todo
====
Push the total to the left on small screens (where there aren't table borders)
Test of IE8
Change loading to saving for editTutor
pickadate issues -- opens halfway, when input is above the top of what it would be at half open
Appparently some people do not have classes on the data sheet, find out and fix
Fix issues with navbar undefined indexes

Future
======
==Functionality
Fix merge downloads/uploads*
Find a way to auto-minify files (must work with GAE)
Less specific dates (like April 2014 - Math Month)
Separate School Years
Scores on competitions
Download/Print Data
Start new year button
==Prettiness
Fix table headers and their alignment when the tbody is hidden/shown
Fix border on tutoring hour day select
On hiding tables, scroll the screen to the top (implement #event, #tutoring, etc.)
Transfer from IDs to Classes
Organize CSS file, make subheaders, move some to inline
Work on touch friendliness*
Remove/standardize the scroll bar, prevent jumps on modal open/close
Work on making modals better*
Work on raising Google Page Speed number

Maybe?
======
tooltip for teacher only buttons?
Add page for teachers to use to enter tutoring hours?
Bring back teachers (allow Hyman to designate people as teachers, though w/ an alert, are teachers (pointwise) handled properly?)?
Standardize variable names?
Will Google make a PHP umm.. database (whatever it is called?)?
Add info buttons? Use Font Awesome for a circle w/ question mark?
Migrate Tutoring Calenders to the site? Would require a month interface that shows stuff at a glance.
Tooltips when hovering over events, shows who attended?
Can I speed up the download process for Google Drive?
Group Requests together? (look into then and when)
Add an "I was here!" button?

Ask Hyman
========
Should Officers be able to see points?

Can't do
========
-the data-divider appears to become unrendered at certain zooms
-fix blue line on access level select (teacher looking at self) (same kind of error, changes with zoom)
-extend the length of the session variable--memcache clears frequently, doesn't appear to let you extend length beyond 30 minutes
-Can't change the pickadate's format after creating them (to make them responsive)

Notes
========Merge Downloads/Uploads=============
---Fix merging with name changes, removals --- fixing for removals should fix everything
-changing names doesn't remove old name
-removing something, they come back
-changing dates, doesn't remove the old one
-->if event is removed, keep everything up to the day
-->if event date is changed, 
-change clear to a close button on the pickadate
-look into array intersections

Warn user if still uploading and attempting to leave
============================================

==============Touch Friendliness===================
-Make buttons darken for a moment longer on touch screens - modernizer? --> basically make it mobile friendly
-Close navbar on touch events
-Fix Tutoring Hours pickadate on mobile screen (change date format)
=============================================

==================Modals=======================
Opening a pickadate and clicking outside of it causes the whole thing to close (i think?)

===============================================

==================Transitions================
-hiding/showing tables, remove each item with a certain delay?
-moving between pages
--Rework to use .ajax or .load (so it stays on one page), then use location.hash or html5 history api to enable the back button (window.history.pushState), or maybe jQuery history plugin?
==============================================
